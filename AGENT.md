# AGENT.md — the scriptorium protocol

You are the scribe. You own **judgment**: what to ingest, how to synthesize, when
two claims conflict, whether an answer deserves to become a page. The `scrip` CLI
owns **determinism**: hashing, staleness, provenance integrity, fact queries.
Never hand-compute a hash or guess whether something is stale — ask `scrip`.

Golden rules:
- **Never edit `vault/raw/`** after ingest. It is immutable. A changed source is a
  *re-ingest*, which is a tracked event.
- **Never silently overwrite** a claim that a new source contradicts. Reconcile.
- After any compile or extract, leave the vault **green**: `scrip status` exits 0
  and `scrip verify` exits 0.

The data contract these steps assume is normative in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

## INGEST — bring a source in

1. Obtain the source text (extract from PDF/HTML if needed). Save it verbatim to
   `vault/raw/<slug>.md`. This stored text is canonical; do not touch it again.
2. Write `vault/raw/<slug>.meta.yaml` with `title`, `author`, `url`, `retrieved`.
3. `scrip status --rebuild-manifest` — the new source registers and shows as
   `UNCOMPILED` (nothing depends on it yet).

## COMPILE — synthesize a wiki page

1. Read the relevant `raw/` source(s).
2. Scaffold the page with the correct frontmatter, then synthesize:
   - `scrip new concept <slug> --from raw/a,raw/b [--title "…"]` (or `entity`)
     writes `vault/wiki/{concepts,entities}/<slug>.md` with `id`, `type`, `title`,
     `derived-from`, `confidence` and an empty body. It refuses to overwrite.
   - Fill the prose. For each claim-bearing sentence, mint a footnote anchor with
     `scrip anchor "<exact quote>" --source raw/<slug>` — it prints a ready-to-paste
     `[^a1]: anchor=raw/<slug>#<anchor>  "…"` line and **exits 1 if the quote is
     not unique** (lengthen it until `OK`). Set `confidence` to your honest rating.
3. `scrip stamp vault/wiki/concepts/<slug>.md` — records the correct `input-hash`
   + `last-compiled` deterministically.
4. `scrip verify` — fix any `BROKEN`/`AMBIGUOUS` anchors (lengthen the quote until
   unique) until it exits 0.

## EXTRACT — pull structured facts

1. From the `raw/` source(s), append records to:
   - `facts/entities.ndjson` — one entity per line.
   - `facts/claims.ndjson` — one claim per line, each with a resolvable `anchor`,
     a `subject`/`predicate`/`object` triple, and a `polarity`
     (`asserts`/`denies`/`qualifies`).
   - `facts/graph.ndjson` — edges (citation/idea relations).
2. Update `facts/_meta.yaml` `derived-from`, then `scrip stamp vault/facts/_meta.yaml`.
3. `scrip verify` (anchors resolve) and `scrip query contradictions` (catch
   self-conflicts before they harden).

## ANSWER — the policy ladder

Descend; stop at the first rung that applies (see [SPEC §9](SPEC.md#9-the-answer-policy-ladder)):

1. `scrip status` the relevant artifact(s); consult `wiki/` + `scrip query` over
   `facts/`.
2. **Hit & fresh** → answer, citing anchors. Done. *(cheap — no re-derivation)*
3. **Hit & stale** → recompile just that artifact (COMPILE/EXTRACT), `scrip stamp`,
   then answer.
4. **Miss** → `scrip search "<question>"` to retrieve candidate source blocks
   (semantic if `scrip index` has been built with the embeddings extra, else
   grep), synthesize an answer, cite it, then **PROMOTE** it.
5. **Conflict surfaced** → **RECONCILE**.

Append a one-line entry to `wiki/log.md` for compiles, promotions, and
reconciliations.

## PROMOTE — turn a good answer into a page

1. Before creating a page, list existing `wiki/concepts/` + `entities/` and score
   overlap with the new topic: normalized-title token overlap + shared `tags` +
   shared `derived-from`.
2. **High overlap** → MERGE into the existing page (append, extend `derived-from`,
   record the absorbed id in `supersedes`). **Low** → create a new page.
   **Middle** → you decide, but only over that small candidate set.
3. Entity pages are strictly 1:1 with `entities.ndjson` rows. Re-`stamp` and
   `verify` after.

## RECONCILE — resolve a contradiction

1. Triggered by `scrip query contradictions` (opposing `polarity`, same
   subject+predicate, different source) **or** a `verify` `BROKEN` anchor from a
   re-ingested source.
2. Read both anchored spans. Decide: **supersede** (one wins; record `supersedes`),
   **qualify** (add a `polarity: qualifies` claim and a caveat in the page), or
   **keep-both** (note the disagreement explicitly).
3. Never silent overwrite. Log the decision in `wiki/log.md`.
